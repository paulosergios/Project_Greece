## Description

This project is a fictional travel website for exploring the beauty of Greece. It is built using React and incorporates basic Bootstrap styling. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my React skills and showcase the usage of Bootstrap for styling.

2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run the command `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run the command `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap` to install React Bootstrap and Bootstrap CSS.

## Usage

## Bootstrap Component

In this project, I utilized Bootstrap to style the travel package listing component. Bootstrap provides a set of pre-styled CSS classes that make it easy to create a responsive and visually appealing layout.

The travel package listing component utilizes Bootstrap classes to display the information of each package in an appealing format. Bootstrap's grid classes and button styling were also used to ensure consistent and responsive presentation of the content.
